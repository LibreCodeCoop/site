1. Free and voluntary membership

Cooperatives are voluntary organizations, open to all people able to use their services and assume responsibilities as members, without gender, social, racial, political and religious discrimination.

2. Democratic management

Cooperatives are democratic organizations, controlled by their members, who actively participate in the formulation of their policies and decision-making. Men and women, elected as representatives of the other members, are responsible to them. In first-degree cooperatives, members have equal voting rights (one member, one vote); Higher-level cooperatives are also organized democratically.

3. Economic participation

Members contribute equitably to the capital of their cooperatives and control it democratically. Part of this capital is normally common property of the cooperative. Members usually receive, if any, remuneration limited to the paid-in capital, as a condition of their membership.

4. Autonomy and independence

Cooperatives are autonomous, mutual aid organizations controlled by their members. If they sign agreements with other organizations, including public institutions, or resort to external capital, they must do so under conditions that ensure democratic control by their members and maintain the autonomy of the cooperative.

5. Education, training and information

Cooperatives promote the education and training of their members, elected representatives and workers, so that they can contribute effectively to the development of their cooperatives. They inform the general public, particularly young people and opinion leaders, about the nature and benefits of cooperation.

6. Intercooperation

It is cooperation between cooperatives, to strengthen the movement as a whole and cooperative principles. This can occur at different levels: through local, regional, national, international structures; between cooperatives of the same system; with cooperatives from other systems; and with cooperatives from other branches of cooperativism.

7. Interest in the community

Cooperatives work for the sustainable development of the communities in which they operate, through policies approved by members. They value investments in projects that are economically viable, environmentally correct and socially fair.
